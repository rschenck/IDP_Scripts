# IDP_Scripts
Scripts used for Intrinsically Disordered Protein Analysis


These scripts were built as part of a project to analyze all vertebrate virus proteomes for intrinsically disordered proteins.

Originally these were written to not utilize NCBI's API; instead I utilized the Selenium Webdriver. While this was an interesting and informative way of accomplishing this task, it is unreasonably slow. I have since switched to BioPython's Efetch method.
